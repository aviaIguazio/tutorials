    "  The platform's Jupyter Notebook, Zeppelin, and web-based shell \"command-line services\" automatically create such a directory for the running user of the service and set it as the home directory of the service environment.\n",
    "  You can leverage the following environment variables, which are predefined in the platform's command-line services, to access this running-user directory from your code:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `V3IO_USERNAME` &mdash; set to the username of the running user of the Jupyter Notebook service.\n",
    "  - `V3IO_HOME` &mdash; set to the running-user directory in the \"users\" container &mdash; **users/&lt;running user&gt;**.\n",
    "  - `V3IO_HOME_URL` &mdash; set to the fully qualified `v3io` path to the running-user directory &mdash; `v3io://users/<running user>`.\n",
    "- <a id=\"projects-container\"></a>**\"projects\"** &mdash; This container is designed to store shared project artifacts.<br>\n",
    "    When creating a new project, the default artifacts path is **projects/&lt;project name&gt;/artifacts**.\n",
    "- <a id=\"bigdata-container\"></a>**\"bigdata\"** &mdash; This container has no special significance in the current release, and it will no longer be predefined in future releases.\n",
    "    However, you'll still be able to use your existing \"bigdata\" container and all its data, or create a custom container by this name if it doesn't already exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data containers and their contents are referenced differently depending on the programming interface.\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In local file-system (FS) commands you use the predefined `v3io` root data mount &mdash; `/v3io/<container name>[/<data path>]`.\n",
    "  There's also a predefined local-FS `User` mount to the **users/&lt;running user&gt;** directory, and you can use the aforementioned environment variables when setting data paths.\n",
    "  For example, `/v3io/users/$V3IO_USERNAME`, `/v3io/$V3IO_HOME`, and `/User` are all valid ways of referencing the **users/&lt;running user&gt;** directory from a local FS command.\n",
    "- In Hadoop FS or Spark DataFrame commands you use a fully qualified path of the format `v3io://<container name>/<data path>`.\n",
    "  You can also use environment variables with these interfaces.\n",
