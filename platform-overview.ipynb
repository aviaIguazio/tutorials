    "\n",
    "> **Note:** Start out by first reading the platform introduction and high-level overview in [**welcome.ipynb**](welcome.ipynb) (notebook) or [**README.md**](README.md) (Markdown).\n",
    "\n",
    "The platform uses [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) (k8s) as the baseline cluster manager, and deploys various application microservices on top of Kubernetes to address different data science tasks.\n",
    "Most of the provided services support scaling out and GPU acceleration and have a secure and low-latency access to the platform's shared data store and file system, enabling high performance and scalability with maximum resource efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "The platform makes extensive use of [Nuclio serverless functions](https://github.com/nuclio/nuclio) to automate various tasks &mdash; such as data collection, extract-transform-load (ETL) processes, model serving, and batch jobs.\n",
    "Nuclio functions describe the code and include all the required resource definitions and configuration for running the code.\n",
    "The functions auto scale and can be versioned.\n",
    "The platform supports various methods for generating Nuclio functions &mdash; using the graphical dashboard, Docker, Git, or Jupyter Notebook &mdash; as demonstrated in the platform tutorials.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following sections detail how you can use the platform to implement all stages of a data science workflow from research to production."

    "  See, for example, the [**file-access**](data-ingestion-and-preparation/file-access.ipynb) tutorial.\n",
    "- Importing time-series telemetry data using a Prometheus compatible scraping API.\n",

    "- [V3IO Frames](https://github.com/v3io/frames) &mdash; Iguazio's open-source data-access library, which provides a unified high-performance API for accessing NoSQL, stream, and time-series data in the platform's data store and features native integration with pandas and [NVIDIA RAPIDS](https://rapids.ai/).\n",
    "  See, for example, the [**frames**](data-ingestion-and-preparation/frames.ipynb) tutorial.\n",
    "- Built-in support for ML packages such as [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org), [Pyplot](https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.html), [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/), [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).\n",

    "Users can easily install additional Python packages by using the [Conda](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/conda) binary package and environment manager and the [pip](https://pip.pypa.io) Python package installer, which are both available as part of the Jupyter Notebook service.\n",
    "This design, coupled with the platform's unified data model, enables users to store and access data using different formats &mdash; such as NoSQL (\"key/value\"), time series, stream data, and files (simple objects) &mdash; and leverage different tools and APIs for accessing and manipulating the data, all from a single development environment (namely, Jupyter Notebook).\n",

    "\n",
    "One of the most important and challenging areas of managing a data science environment is the ability to track experiments.\n",
    "Data scientists need a simple way to track and view current and historical experiments along with the metadata that is associated with each experiment.\n",
    "This capability is critical for comparing different runs, and eventually helps to determine the best model and configuration for production deployment.\n",

    "The platform allows you to easily deploy your models to production in a reproducible way by using the open-source Nuclio serverless framework.\n",
    "You provide Nuclio with code or Jupyter notebooks, resource definitions (such as CPU, memory, and GPU), environment variables, package or software dependencies, data links, and trigger information.\n",
    "Nuclio uses this information to automatically build the code, generate custom container images, and connect them to the relevant compute or data resources.\n",
    "The functions can be triggered by a wide variety of event sources, including the most commonly used streaming and messaging protocols, HTTP APIs, scheduled (cron) tasks, and batch jobs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nuclio functions can be created from the platform dashboard or by using standard code IDEs, and can be deployed on your platform cluster.\n",
    "A convenient way to develop and deploy Nuclio functions is by using Jupyter Notebook and Python tools.\n",

    "\n",
    "> **Note:** Nuclio functions aren't limited to model serving: they can automate data collection, serve custom APIs, build real-time feature vectors, drive triggers, and more.\n",

    "For an overview of Nuclio and how to develop, document, and deploy serverless Python Nuclio functions from Jupyter Notebook, see the [nuclio-jupyter documentation](https://github.com/nuclio/nuclio-jupyter/blob/master/README.md).\n",
    "You can also find examples in the platform tutorials.\n",

    "The platform supports multiple standard data analytics and visualization tools, including SQL, Prometheus, Grafana, and pandas.\n",
    "For example, you can plot or chart data within Jupyter Notebook using [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/); use your favorite BI visualization tools, such as [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com), to query data in the platform over a Java database connectivity connector (JDBC); or build real-time dashboards in Grafana.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data analytics and visualization tools and services generate telemetry and log data that can be stored using the platform's time-series database (TSDB) service or by using external tools such as [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch).\n",
